                                We’re a passionate duo of developers who poured our hearts and skills into creating Binaurapp. Over the past few years, we've not only built every aspect of this app ourselves but also crafted a unique audio player from scratch. Our journey has been deeply influenced by years of research in neuroscience and music, culminating in the groundbreaking theory of “Moving Binaural Waves” (MBW) by Matias Kamelman.

                                Our mission goes beyond just offering a great app; we're committed to pushing the boundaries of what binaural audio can achieve. We're continuously exploring and testing new ideas, and we’re excited to bring our research into the lab to make even more amazing discoveries.
