## Overview 🌟

**Binaurapp** is an innovative application designed to enhance your mental well-being through binaural audio. Our goal is to help you achieve states of sleep, relaxation, concentration, and well-being using advanced sound technologies. Discover personalized programs to reduce stress, improve focus, or find moments of calm.

The theory of moving binaural waves, discovered by **Matias Kamelman**, uses 5th-order ambisonics to create an immersive sound environment that induces specific brain states without active user participation. This approach provides objective and passive results, differentiating Binaurapp from other applications.

Additionally, Binaurapp is the only app that allows you to connect to your Spotify account to choose your desired music, based on the music therapy theory that no music is inherently relaxing or stimulating—it always depends on the user and their cultural and personal background.

## Features 🚀

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup functionality.
- **Binaural Audio Programs**: Access to various audio programs designed for relaxation and focus.
